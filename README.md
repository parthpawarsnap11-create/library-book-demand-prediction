Library Book Demand Prediction System

This project implements a minimal end-to-end Machine Learning system to predict the demand level of university library books as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** based on historical and academic features.

The goal of this project is not only to build a predictive model, but also to demonstrate a **production-like ML pipeline** including data generation, model training, evaluation, deployment via a dashboard, and version control.

Problem Statement

University libraries often face challenges in managing book inventory efficiently. Some books are in very high demand during certain semesters, while others remain underutilized. This system helps predict the **demand level of books** using features such as:

- Subject
- Semester
- Past borrow count
- Course relevance

This prediction can help libraries in:
- Better inventory planning
- Budget allocation
- Deciding number of copies to keep for each book
